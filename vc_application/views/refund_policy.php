			<p class="text-left">In the rarest of rare cases, we have come terms to any refund requests from our clients. Mostly, it's due to the choice of product which goes wrong from client's side but we respect our client's wishes. If they found that they aren't contended with the product and need their refunds, then we do as per their request. <br>
				If you aren't too happy with the product then you need to follow a simple process under which you need to make call to our customer care executive and request him/her to make that specific change. Or you can also login to our official website and request for a refund of your order. <br>
